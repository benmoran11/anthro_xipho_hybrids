# anthro_xipho_hybrids
Scripts for reproducing the results of Moran et al. 2025, studying anthropogenic hybridization in Xiphophorus malinche x birchmanni

The scripts included here were used in the analysis for "Increased rates of hybridization in swordtail fish are associated with water pollution" (Moran et al. 2025 bioRxiv). Files are organized by general group of analyses, and are written in a combination of R, Linux Bash, and Java Script. The relevant input files can be found at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nvx0k6f5h, while raw sequencing files can be found under SRA BioProjects PRJNA1346846, PRJNA930165, PRJNA610049, and PRJNA744894.
